Quantum-Inspired Linear Regression

This repository contains my implementation of a quantum-inspired linear regression algorithm, blending quantum mechanics principles with machine learning optimization. I've built core components (gradient descent, quantum-enhanced training, cost calculation) using Java to explore how quantum concepts like superposition and tunneling can enhance traditional linear regression.

Implementation Details

Technologies Used





Java: For implementing core algorithms (gradient descent, quantum tunneling, prediction).



Mathematical Foundations: Linear regression, gradient descent, quantum mechanics principles (superposition, tunneling).

Project Components

The project is structured into modular Java classes (as described in the PDF):





gradientdescent.java: Implements batch gradient descent for parameter optimization.



QuantumEnhancedTrainer.java: Manages multiple parameter vectors, applying quantum tunneling via controlled noise injection.



MemoryBank.java and MemoryQuantumState.java: Store successful parameter vectors with probabilistic amplitudes based on inverse cost.



prediction.java: Computes predictions using ( f_{w,b}(x) = w \cdot x + b ).



costcalculator.java: Calculates the cost function ( J(\theta) ) using Mean Squared Error.

Quantum-Inspired Approach





Superposition: Maintains ( N ) parallel parameter vectors ( {\theta_1, \theta_2, \dots, \theta_N} ), each evolving independently to explore the loss landscape.



Quantum Tunneling: Adds controlled noise (double noise = (Math.random() * 2 - 1) * scale) to escape local minima.



Probabilistic Amplitudes: Assigns weights to parameter vectors based on ( \frac{1}{\text{cost}} ), mimicking quantum wavefunction probabilities.

Mathematical Framework

The algorithm builds on traditional linear regression:





Cost function: ( J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum (h_{\theta}(x) - y)^2 )



Gradient descent: ( \theta := \theta - \alpha \nabla J(\theta) )

Enhanced by quantum-inspired techniques to avoid local minima and explore multiple solutions simultaneously.
